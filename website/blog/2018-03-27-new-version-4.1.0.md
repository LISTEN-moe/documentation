*note: this gif doesn't in any way describe our development process*


Two months ago we released v4 to the public and it has been a huge success! The new design was received with a bunch of positive feedback and we are working on it everyday to make it better.

This new version brings a few new additions to our platform, but the most important one has to be that we are now streaming **[kpop](https://listen.moe/kpop)** too!

By clicking on the ++kpop++ button on the header of the site, you'll be able to seamlessly transition from one platform to the other, automatically switching streams and everything. Give it a try!

As I said before part of our vision as a platform is to bring you the best music and the smoothest of services, so by adding kpop to LISTEN.moe we are hoping to bring all the best Asian music we find to you, our beloved listeners.

*A little note for supporters; your daily requests are platform-independent meaning that if you have like 10 requests, you can queue up 10 songs on each platform.*

Small changelog of stuff we added and fixed:
- Reworked how feeds work. System feeds and personal ones are separated from each other now.
- When linking the radio on other sites or services, like Discord, the correct metadata will show up. You can now go an brag about your user profile.
- Added a cute little animation while you wait for the page and the songs table to load.
- When there is a new blog post, you should be receiving a notification with a dot.
- Clicking on a profile picture on comments and such now takes you to that person's profile
- If you forgot your password, you can now request a reset via email.
- Every song should have a ~10s snippet so you can listen to it before requesting
- Overall fixes and improvements that make the site faster and more stable.
